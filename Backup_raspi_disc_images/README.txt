Everything running well for at least 2 weeks.  Last night, I flashed the TI-stick and modified my openaps.ini, preflight, loop and udev rules files to accomodate.  Ran well all last night and today.  This backup occurs prior to running GParted on the 16gb card to get it down below 8gb, to fit the backup card.

Closed day and night for ~48 hours.  Just addded reboot every 30 minutes during nighttime to cron, but haven't tested it yet (will do so night of 5/1)

First full day of closed-looping, all at home on wifi.  Using wicd-curses, removed all static IPs and went back to DDNS, with the hostname pipan.local to find it on network/putty.

After starting from 4-09 backup, I rebuilt stuff.  It's been open-looping successfully all day.  Wi-fi jumped between home/hotspot/work/hotspot/work/hotspot/home with minimal reboots.  Problems discovered later, as I was using static IPs.

Everything (theoretically) working with nightscout upload, cron jobs, etc.  Still open looping.  But, did something stupid and now I can't get WICD to upload (wifi) manager.

First time everything was working with loop, but not cron and/or nightscout upload.
