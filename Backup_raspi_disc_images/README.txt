After starting from 4-09 backup, I rebuilt stuff.  It's been open-looping successfully all day.  Wi-fi jumped between home/hotspot/work/hotspot/work/hotspot/home with minimal reboots.

Everything (theoretically) working with nightscout upload, cron jobs, etc.  Still open looping.  But, did something stupid and now I can't get WICD to upload (wifi) manager.

First time everything was working with loop, but not cron and/or nightscout upload.
